##JavaScript Engine

###Interpreter
Program is run line by line 'on the fly'

cons:

###Compiler
Works ahead of time, to create a translation and is compiled down into a language that is understood by CPU.A new program is written and that program is fed to the machine.

###JIT
Just in time compiling, allows for a program execution that allows both interpretation and compilation.

pros: optimization: Can simplify repeated code. In other words can make edits to redundant code that allow the cpu to skip calculations that have already been made.
